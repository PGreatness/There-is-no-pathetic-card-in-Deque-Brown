# Operations into Deque-ing
## By Team Lenovo 3.0 (Roster: Ahnaf Hasan, Kevin Wang, Peter Cwalina)

The methods defined from the [Deque API](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Deque.html) page in QQKachoo are as follows.
- size()
- addFirst()
- addLast()
- peekFirst()
- peekLast()
- removeFirst()
- removeLast()
- removeFirstOccurrence()
- removeLastOccurrence()
- Iterator()
- poll()
- pollFirst()
- offerFirst()
- offerLast()
- contains()

_Note that the implementation of the methods may not reflect the order that they were placed in in the README_

A doubly linked node-based architecture was implemented because it allows easy trasversal between nodes, and saves both time and memory by having both a front an end modifiable in constant time.

The various elements explored in this repo stems from the Deque class available in the Java API. The methods are developed through a bottom-up approach where the most basic of the methods are added and revised by a team of three.

4 steps of maintaining runnability (To-do list):

1. Maintain runnability
2. Implement basic methods as listed above
3. Generic type Interface and class
4. Implement Iterator in Deque
